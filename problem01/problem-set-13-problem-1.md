# Module 8 - Problem Set No. 13 Problem 1

## Create a Car Class

Create a class named Car.

When the class is instantiated three instance variables are defined:

- __make
- __model
- __year

The constructor function should include the parameters make, model and year.

Six methods are to be created in the **Car** class:

- set_make(self,make) which sets self.make
- set_model(self,model) which sets self.model
- set_year(self,year) which sets self.year
- get_make(self) returns self.make
- get_model(self) returns self.model
- get_year(self) return self.year

Create a main() function that

- Create a list named **carLot**
- Add 5 Car objects to the list. Make up the makes, models and years for each of your cars.
- Create a loop that displays each cars properties for each car object in the list
- Create another loop that iterates through the list of cars and calls each of the three set methods to change the make, model and year of each car. You will need to complete the code for these.
- Create a loop that displays each cars properties of each object in the list using the three get methods defined in the class. You will need complete the code for these.
- Call the main() function to run the program
