# Module 8 - Problem Set No. 13 Problem 2

## Create a Simple Student Class

Develop a class named **Student** that holds the following data about a student in attributes:

- name 
- ID number
- major
- GPA

Once you have written the class, write a program that creates a list and stores four Student object elements.

Use the following data:

```text
Name            ID Number       Major           GPA
Joe Bella       9933            Web Development 3.8
Tucker Blank    3399            Nursing         3.0
Gayle Ujifusa   1011            Baking          2.8
Edna Anker      9875            Medical Office  3.0
```

Now write a loop that iterates through the list of objects and displays each of the objects properties.
